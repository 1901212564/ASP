## Course overview: 
Applied Stochastic Processes (ASP) is intended for the students who are
seeking advanced knowledge in stochastic calculus and are eventually interested in the jobs in
financial engineering. As the name indicates, the course will emphasis on applications such as
numerical calculation and programming. On completion of this course, the students will learn
how financial observations (e.g. stock prices and FX rate) are modelled with stochastic
processes and how they can be computed using analytics or computer simulations.

## Prerequisites: 
[Stochastic Finance](https://github.com/PHBS/2018.M3.StoFin) (FIN 519), a year 1 required course for quantitative finance program, is a prerequisite for the ASP since it provides theoretical background. Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability, statistics, linear algebra and programming skill (Python) are also highly recommended.
